# Hi, I'm Lau (Laudivan) 👋
### Senior DevOps Engineer | Infrastructure Architect | CS Bachelor | IT Management Specialist

> *"I've been taming servers since before 'Cloud' was a buzzword."*

I am a **Senior Infrastructure Specialist** with over **20 years of experience** bridging the gap between hardware, OS, and software development. Based in Brazil, looking for global opportunities (Remote/Relocation).

My background isn't just "using tools"; it's about deep understanding of **Linux/Windows internals**, networking, and building resilient systems. I combine the rigor of a **Computer Science** background with the strategic view of **IT Management**.

### 🛠️ The Arsenal (Tech Stack)

I treat Infrastructure as Code, but I know how to fix it when the code breaks the infrastructure.

* **Core Engineering:** C, Python, Java, Shell Scripting (Bash/PowerShell).
* **Operating Systems:** Linux (RHEL, Debian, CentOS - Deep internals), Windows Server (AD, GPO, IIS).
* **DevOps & Cloud:** Docker, Podman, CI/CD Pipelines (Jenkins/GitLab CI), AWS/Azure basics.
* **Observability & Management:** Zabbix, Ansible, Terraform.
* **Database:** PostgreSQL, MySQL/MariaDB, SQL Server (Administration & Tuning).

### 🧠 Engineering Philosophy

* **Automation First:** If I have to do it twice, I script it. If I have to do it thrice, I build a system for it.
* **Root Cause Analysis:** I don't apply patches; I fix the underlying architectural flaw.
* **Interdisciplinary Approach:** My AH/SD (Giftedness) profile drives me to constantly learn and connect dots that others miss, from low-level optimization to high-level project management.

### 💼 Career Highlights

* **DevOps Integration:** Led the cultural and technical shift to DevOps at previous enterprise roles (e.g., Aliare), automating build/deploy processes that reduced release times drastically.
* **Hybrid Infrastructure:** Designed and managed hybrid environments (On-premise + Cloud) for high-availability systems.
* **Legacy to Modern:** Expert in modernizing legacy monolithic infrastructure without breaking production.
